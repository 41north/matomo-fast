## 💡 Introduction

[Matomo](https://github.com/matomo-org) is the leading open-source analytics platform that gives you more than just powerful analytics:

- Free open-source software
- 100% data ownership
- User privacy protection
- User-centric insights

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for running the services with Docker.
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) enabled.
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) for talking to Matomo.
